    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

> Test if a string starts with the characters of another string.

## Usage

```javascript
import startsWith from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/string-starts-with@esm/index.mjs';
```

#### startsWith( str, search\[, position] )

Tests if a string starts with the characters of another string.

```javascript
var str = 'To be, or not to be, that is the question.';

var bool = startsWith( str, 'To be' );
// returns true

bool = startsWith( str, 'to be' );
// returns false
```

By default, the function searches from the beginning of the input string. To search from a different character index, provide a `position` value (zero-based). If provided a negative `position`, the start index is determined relative to the string end (i.e., `pos = str.length + position`).

```javascript
var str = 'Remember the story I used to tell you when you were a boy?';

var bool = startsWith( str, 'the story' );
// returns false

bool = startsWith( str, 'the story', 9 );
// returns true

bool = startsWith( str, 'you', -15 );
// returns true
```

If provided an empty `search` string, the function **always** returns `true`.

```javascript
var str = 'beep boop';

var bool = startsWith( str, '' );
// returns true
```

## Notes

-   This function differs from [`String.prototype.startsWith`][mdn-string-startswith] in the following ways:

    -   The function requires string values for the first and second arguments and requires that the `position` argument be an integer value.
    -   The function does **not** clamp negative `position` values. Instead, when provided a negative `position`, the function resolves the starting search position relative to the end of the string.
    -   Except when provided an empty `search` string, the function **always** returns `false` is a `position` resolves to a starting search position which exceeds the bounds of the input string.
